# Larkin Calendar

## Status

`Incomplete` ðŸ˜¢
The sole calendar itself is completed. And maybe not polished.

## Description

This is an app my team created during the 24 hours for project submission of the Hack&Roll 2023 hackathon.

This Larkin Calendar app's purpose is to resolve schedule conflict between teammate.

## Technology

This app is using Next.js. Why? We planned to call API to request data from Google Calendar. Of course, we never reach this stage unfortunately.

## Setup

Just `git clone` this and `npm install`.

Then run:

    npm run dev
